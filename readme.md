# Referral Suite

Manage incoming referrals from social media ads before sending them to the mission's areas! But here's the best part: ANYONE can use it!

<br>

## Basic Overview
Referral Suite is broken up into 2 big parts: The site and the Client. The client technically isn't needed at all if using a computer, but if you want to use it on a Missionary Device which has MaaS360. Here's the link to the [Referral Suite Client](https://github.com/ssmission/referral-suite-client).

### Edit Pre-written Template Messages

1. Navigate to the `templates` folder
2. Open the `email` or `sms` folder, whichever you'd like to edit
3. Open the file for which you'd like to edit the prewritten templates
4. Edit/Paste-in/delete whichever you'd like.
5. __Keep In Mind:__ Referral Suite will separate each of these into individual texts __When there is at least 3 line breaks in between messages!__ For instance:

* This creates 1 message:
```txt
1| Hejsan jag heter Michael! Jag s친g att du fr친gade efter en gratis Mormons Bok
2|
3|
4| Hur 칛r det med dig?
```
<br>

* This creates 2 messages:
```txt
1| Hejsan jag heter Michael! Jag s친g att du fr친gade efter en gratis Mormons Bok
2|
3|
4|
5| Hur 칛r det med dig?
```
